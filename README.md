# README-Generator-NodeJs-HW-09

# Description
Inquirer is an easily integrated and beautiful command line interface for Node.js that provides user interface and query session flow to create different forms. 

In this project, we created a README.md generator, which helps the user to create from scratch a page just by answering questions about the project using commands in "the terminal".

As a user, feel free to interact with the terminal, by answering the multiple questions and create a new "README.md".
